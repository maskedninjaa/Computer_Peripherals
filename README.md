This is my third project done from scratch in java.

I pushed the project from IntelliJ!

The program I made asks the user to describe their computer peripherals, such as their keyboard, monitor, and mouse.

The program incorpates OOP (Object Oriented Programming), and helped me implement what I've learned so far in java.
